# Virtual Mail Project 🏢📬

## Overview
Step-by-step JavaScript projects to build a **Virtual Post Office** app. Letters travel between SA mail hubs with tracking, delays, and shortest paths.

**Structure:** Each folder is a self-contained task. Open `test.html` (if present), edit `script.js`, test in browser console (F12).

## Current Projects
- **project1-closest-hub/**: Find closest post office from lat/long (JS objects + functions + distance calc).

## How to Work
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/brandoncrabpi/virtual-mail-project`
2. `cd project1-closest-hub`
3. Open `test.html` → F12 Console → Test function.
4. Edit `script.js` → Refresh → Test.
5. Commit/push when done.
